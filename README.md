# A2YAutoAccount

This is a simple program for quickly creating A2Y accounts in the development environment. This tool is ONLY to be used for testing the development environment with the accounts created.

In the advent that an error occurs partway through account creation and the iteration count is not incremented, please click the "Iterations" label in order to manually increment it. Additionally if needed, the iteration count may be decremented by right-clicking the "iterations" label.
